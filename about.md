#### Professional
I am a Software Engineer at Human Longevity Inc. We leverage massive amounts of 
sequencing, phenotyping, and metabolics data to extend healthy human life. 
<br>

#### Personal
I love rock climbing, soccer, hiking, and meditation. I became interested in health research
through volunteer experiences in Ecuador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. I am also lucky enough to be engaged to Daisy, the love of my life. 
We have two cute doggies too!
