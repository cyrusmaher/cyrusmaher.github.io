#### Professional
I have deep training in statistical computing, machine 
learning, chemical biology, and epidemiology.  In August, I will be finishing 
my PhD after three years.
By the time I am done, I will have completed
seven primary author manuscripts and 
two software packages.  It is my goal
to leverage this diverse blend of training to contribute
meaningfully to the treatment and prevention of human disease.

#### Personal
I love rock climbing, soccer, hiking, and meditation. I became interested in health research
through volunteer experiences in Ecuador and Honduras. I'm engaged to the love of my life. She is awesome. We have two cute doggies too!
