Many bloggers have written vividly about the bittersweet process of leaving academia. The stories are strikingly similar. At a certain point, the pressure, the uncertainty, the long hours, the low-ish wages, and the endless moving from city to city simply become cumulatively unsustainable. One comes to realize that most of these circumstances do not abate if one beats the odds and lands a junior faculty position. One recognizes that, for better or for worse, this is the deal. Take it or leave it.

#### Thinking about leaving
I once overheard an undergraduate researcher ask a junior faculty member about getting into academic science. His reply was simple, "If you can imagine yourself doing anything else, go do that." At the time I felt his advice to be overly pessimistic. Now, I have to say that I agree with him. So I'm going to go another route. Similar to Lenny Teytelman's [experience leaving academia](http://anothersb.blogspot.com/2014/02/goodbye-academia.html), "I feel liberated and happy, and this is a very bad sign for the future of life sciences in the United States." I'll table this last part for another day, though :)


#### The data behind the decision
As you can see below, in 2011 there were ~35,000 new PhD graduates, but only about ~3,000 faculty openings. Academic science is overstaffed, and that is leading to unhealthy levels of competition for those who remain. Despite this persistent trend, Francis Collins has stated that he does not believe there is an oversupply of PhDs. This is partly because, even as the situation in academia is becoming increasingly dire, the "unreasonable effectiveness of data" is leading to an explosion of research positions in industries from advertising to [biomedicine](http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2014_06_13/science.opms.r1400143). In short, we _are_ needed, but mostly not in academia.

#### Pulling the trigger

The decision to leave academia has been compared to a [break up](http://anothersb.blogspot.com/2014/04/dear-academia-i-loved-you-but-im.html). For me, it's been a surprisingly emotional decision, especially when I feel like I'm letting down people I care about. But at the end of the day, I've thought this through backwards and forwards, and I know in my bones that it's right, so I've just gotta put on my big boy pants and go for it.

My father also had a shot at becoming a professor, but he too went into industry instead. He took a job at Union Carbide, in part so that he could support my mom and older brother. During his ~30 year tenure at the company, he produced more than 40 patents. He didn't gain much visibility from his work, but his insights were applied to globally distributed products. Today, you probably can't go an afternoon without touching something made better or cheaper by his work. 

I provide this anecdote a.) because I'm proud of my dad, and b.) to make the point that there are (many) jobs in industry where you can have good career opportunities, solid pay, a high quality of life, _and_ make a real impact. For someone who doesn't mind being a little picky, I honestly don't see a downside. 

#### (Unsollicited) advice for graduate students
The complexion of science has changed rapidly over the last decade. As a result, conventional wisdom often is not consistent with present circumstances. Graduate students and postdocs need to take an active role in evaluating the situation for themselves, and in demanding greater support in preparing for their most likely career outcomes. Going into industry is not failing or selling out. "Industry" isn't even really a thing. For many, it's a catch-all term for "that not-academia stuff I never experienced". If you wonder what it's like, go and look up some job postings in your area. If you find something that looks interesting, considering tailoring your training to prepare yourself for that type of job.
