I've long been interested in how we can understand complex systems without dissecting out the interdependence 
that causes them to come to life. I deeply admire and value the control and certainty that a well-constructed experiment
can provide, but from the data analysis side, I think there's much more we can do to gain a preliminary understanding of potentially interesting causal relationships. 

As a step in that direction, I've created CauseMap, an implementation of convergent cross mapping, a method developed by the [Sugihara group](http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/gsugihara) at UCSD. The method is fairly different from what most have been exposed to, so I've tried to consolidate some useful explanatory resources on the project website. Check it out at [cyrusmaher.github.io/CauseMap.jl](cyrusmaher.github.io/CauseMap.jl)!
